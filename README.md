## TODO list:
- [ ] clean up the base styling so it looks a little nicer (Joe? Im not good at this)
- [ ] Add some basic logging for profile creation/ job or company creation
- [ ] Look for smaller bugs that we can get rid of and then try to move code to production on a random domain (buy something)
- [ ] populate the TODO list (more)
